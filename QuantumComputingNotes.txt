Expirements: facts of life says:
===========================

E = hf
and lambda = h/p

Î¨(x,t) is a wave function which can completely describe state of such particle

and the probability density of a particle can be obtained with the square of
such function, which is multiplication of itself with its complex conjugate.
=========================

Hadamard Transform in classical takes nlogn (where n = 2^m) while in QC it is a
gate and so it is O(1)
